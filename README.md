# Glycated Hemoglobin (GlyHb) Regression Analysis

This project implements multiple regression models to predict Glycated Hemoglobin (GlyHb) levels using a dataset containing 18 features related to health and demographics. The target variable is `glyhb`. The dataset includes a mix of numerical and categorical features, with some missing values handled appropriately.

### Features:
- **ID**: Unique identifier  
- **Cholesterol (chol)**, **Stabilized Glucose (stab.glu)**, **HDL**, **Height**, **Weight**, **Blood Pressure (bp.1s, bp.1d, bp.2s, bp.2d)**, **Waist**, **Hip**, etc.
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Location, Frame

### Models Used:
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor  

This analysis evaluates the performance of these models in predicting GlyHb levels, exploring the relationships between health metrics and GlyHb.
